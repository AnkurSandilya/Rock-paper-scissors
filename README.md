Basic Game that orignate from Japan. 
I just want to automate the basic game that we used to play when we are kid . Because every child don't have any companion with whom they can play.
I builded this just for practice .
The purpose of this project is just brush up my learning till now .
I have learned thing like how to create object , how to access objects ,about JSON files  ,onclick function , function , return statement, if -else conditioning and many more new things .  
In this we are using Math.random ( ) to get computer choice using if else condition . After that we are taking userChoice and comparing it with that computerChoice to get result of the game.

Thanks for reading .
